# GaussianProcessesSelecting
The code I developed during my 2013 summer project at UCL Astronomy Department. It processes lightcurve data from the Kepler database to support a model that identifies exoplanets. It loads a dataset, normalises it and reduces the dataset based on its size, so that intervals from the timeseries are removed. It then plots the lightcurves for comparison.
